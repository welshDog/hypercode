Title,Body,Labels
"[VIS1] Bio-Logic Engine Core","Implement the base biological logic engine (BioLogic.ts) to handle DNA sequences, restriction enzymes, and ligation rules. Must support sticky ends and circularization logic.","VIS1,bio-engine,high-priority"
"[VIS1] Sequence & Enzyme Nodes","Create React Flow nodes for 'Sequence' (DNA input) and 'Enzyme' (Restriction cutter). Enzyme node must use BioLogic to generate fragments with overhangs.","VIS1,nodes,frontend"
"[VIS1] Ligase Node Implementation","Create 'Ligase' node that accepts upstream fragments and validates compatibility. Visual feedback for successful ligation (linear vs circular).","VIS1,nodes,frontend"
"[VIS2] Focus Mode (Hyperfocus)","Implement 'Hyperfocus Mode' toggle. When active, dim all nodes except the selected one and its immediate neighbors (radius 1). Reduce visual noise for ADHD accessibility.","VIS2,ux,accessibility"
"[VIS2] Semantic Level of Detail (LOD)","Implement zoom-dependent rendering. High zoom = full details (sequences). Low zoom = block view (icons only). optimize performance and cognitive load.","VIS2,ux,rendering"
"[VIS3] BioPython Exporter","Create an engine to traverse the React Flow graph and generate executable Python code using Biopython (Bio.Restriction, Bio.Seq).","VIS3,export,backend"
"[VIS3] Qiskit Exporter","Create an engine to traverse Quantum nodes and generate Qiskit Python code for quantum circuit execution.","VIS3,export,quantum"
"[VIS4] Transcription Node (DNA->RNA)","Add 'Transcribe' node. Support both Coding and Template strand inputs. Visual pulse on processing.","VIS4,nodes,bio-engine"
"[VIS4] Translation Node (RNA->Protein)","Add 'Translate' node. Implement standard codon table lookup. Support DNA->Protein direct translation shortcut.","VIS4,nodes,bio-engine"
"[VIS4] CRISPR-Cas9 Node","Implement CRISPR node with Guide RNA (20bp) and PAM (NGG) inputs. Real-time regex scanning of upstream sequence for off-target matches.","VIS4,nodes,crispr"
"[VIS5] Storage Abstraction Layer","Define `IStorageProvider` interface to decouple UI from storage logic. Prepare for future switch to Cloud/SQL.","VIS5,architecture,backend"
"[VIS5] Local JSON Import/Export","Implement 'Save to File' (download .json) and 'Load from File' (upload .json). Ensure full graph state persistence.","VIS5,features,mvp"
"[Future] Cloud Storage Integration","Implement `CloudStorageProvider` (Firebase/Supabase) to replace LocalStorageProvider. Enable cross-device sync.","backlog,cloud"
"[Future] Accessibility Audit (WCAG)","Audit HyperFlow Editor for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader support for canvas interaction.","backlog,accessibility"
