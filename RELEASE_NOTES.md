# HyperCode v0.2-alpha: Production Golden Gate + Dyslexia Mode 🧬👁️

## 🎉 Major Milestones

### Golden Gate Assembly Engine
- ✅ **Multi-enzyme support**: Full support for BsaI, BbsI, and SapI.
- ✅ **Dynamic Logic**: Generic cut-site calculation based on enzyme geometry (no hardcoding).
- ✅ **Validation**: Comprehensive unit tests covering recognition, extraction, and ligation.
- ✅ **Production-Grade**: Moved from "mock" implementation to data-driven biology.

### Accessibility Features
- ✅ **Dyslexia Mode**: Toggle with `Shift + D` or via the `👁️` toolbar button.
- ✅ **High-Legibility Font Stack**: Uses `Comic Sans MS`, `Chalkboard SE`, or `Comic Neue`.
- ✅ **Enhanced Spacing**: `1.8` line-height and `0.05em` letter-spacing for reduced visual crowding.

### Architecture Cleanup
- ✅ **Legacy Archived**: V1/V2 code moved to `archive/` and ignored by Git.
- ✅ **Lessons Learned**: Documented architectural evolution in `archive/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`.
- ✅ **Modular Structure**: Clear separation between `hypercode-core` (Backend) and `hyperflow-editor` (Frontend).

## 🚀 What's Next
- End-to-End simulation loop validation.
- Alpha testing with neurodivergent coders + biologists.
- Community feedback on accessibility features.
