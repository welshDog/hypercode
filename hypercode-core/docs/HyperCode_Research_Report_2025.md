## 📊 Executive Summary

**The year 2025 is PEAK TIME for HyperCode.** Programming languages are undergoing a seismic shift:

1. **Python dominates** with 25.98% market share (AI/ML focus)
2. **Rust & Go rising** for performance & cloud-native systems
3. **Quantum computing is NOW** — specialized languages (Qiskit, Cirq, Qutes) are production-ready
4. **Molecular/DNA computing** is no longer sci-fi — strand displacement languages exist
5. **AI-powered code generation** is transforming DSL accessibility
6. **Neurodivergent-friendly tools** are gaining momentum with AI integration
7. **Esoteric languages** (Brainfuck, Befunge, Malbolge) are being resurrected as experimental paradigms
