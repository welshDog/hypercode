# 🚀 START HERE: HyperCode Research & Documentation Package

**Welcome, HyperCode Architect!**

You have just received the complete Research & Documentation package for the HyperCode project. This package is designed to be the "source of truth" for the entire project, covering everything from the high-level vision to the low-level quantum algorithms.

## 📂 What's Inside?

This workspace contains a set of comprehensive documents and scripts to get your GitHub repository ready for the world.

### 1. Research Documentation (`docs/RESEARCH/`)
*   **`HyperCode_Project_Understanding.md`**: The "Elevator Pitch" and high-level overview. Start here to understand the *Soul* of HyperCode.
*   **`HyperCode_DEEP_DIVE.md`**: The "Bible" of HyperCode. A massive, detailed specification of the language, the architecture, and the implementation.
*   **`QUANTUM_ALGORITHMS_SUPER_DEEP_DIVE.md`**: A masterclass in Quantum Computing within HyperCode.
*   **`QUANTUM_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`**: Cheat sheets for gates, syntax, and common patterns.

### 2. Integration & Setup (`/`)
*   **`setup-research-docs.sh` / `.bat`**: Scripts to automatically organize your workspace.
*   **`GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`**: Step-by-step instructions for pushing to GitHub.

## ⚡ Quick Start Action Plan

**Step 1: Run the Setup Script**
This will ensure all files are in the correct locations (`docs/RESEARCH/`).
```bash
# On Linux/Mac/Git Bash
bash setup-research-docs.sh .

# On Windows (Command Prompt)
setup-research-docs.bat
```

**Step 2: Read the Core Docs**
*   Open `docs/RESEARCH/HyperCode_Project_Understanding.md` to ground yourself in the vision.
*   Skim `docs/RESEARCH/HyperCode_DEEP_DIVE.md` to see the technical depth.

**Step 3: Push to GitHub**
Follow the instructions in `GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to initialize your repo and share this masterpiece with the world.

## 🧩 The HyperCode Vision

HyperCode is **Neurodivergent-First**.
It is **Multi-Paradigm** (Classical, Quantum, Molecular).
It is **Dual-Syntax** (Text & Visual).

*We are building the future of programming for the minds that think differently.*

**Let's Build.** 🚀
